# Web---Simple-Calculator
A web-based Calculator similar to that of windows. 

Calculations have been done server-side.

There is no difference between the C and CE buttons.

Repeating pressing the = button does not issue new calculations.

Exceptions such as dividing by 0 are handled by displaying an E (Error).
